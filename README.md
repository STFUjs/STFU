# STFU
STFU: STANDARD TEXT FORMAT, UNIVERSAL

<pre>
<H1>Starting Notes:</H1>

All numbers are inclusive [0i..5i]
such as for(i=0;i<=5;i++) or while(i>=0){i--}

<H1>Bit Switch:</H1>

00xxxxxx [0i..5i] "6 bit" Number
01xxxxxx Control Symbol
1* Formal ("UTF8" style) Expander

---
<H1>All Characters are in Expanders</H1>

ALL "letters" or symbols "character" <= 127
are encoded in 2-byte Expanders:

110xxxxx 10xxxxxx

"letter" 'a' is 110 00000 10 1100001

Numbers and some Control Symbols are mapped from "ascii" of the corresponding "character".

---
<H1>Expanders, Extenders & UTF8</H1>

All 8-bit Byte Extenders are available:

len byte[0]  byte[1]  byte[2]  byte[3] ...

"UTF8":

2 [10i]    110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
3 [15i]    1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
4 [20i]    11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

<B>The "Books" above 2^23i include the "UTF" in slot 0
and the forms, layout, tooling, phonemes,
and properly sorted "Code Points"; 11111000 is "UTF"</b>

5 [25i] 111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
6 [30i] 1111110x + 5√ó 10xxxxxx
7 [35i] 11111110 + 6√ó 10xxxxxx
8 [41i] 11111111 + 7√ó 10xxxxxx + Another Expander

---
<H1>Symbol Tables</H1>

For any Symbol Table: A Control Symbol or Chracter $

$(index)

$(number'index'tree)(v)

or

$({Any Extenders})

$({Any Extenders}'iNd3X'{Any Extenders}'TreE)

But not mixed in any Turn.

<H2>Adding Time:</H2>

The initial time slice can be included for temporal versioning,
it's associated references per referenced initial time as well.

Numbers are 6-bit, the initial time slice is msb aligned to resolution.

$5i5i() and $5i5i()()

$5i5i56() and $5i5i56()()

---
<H1>HTTP Bytes</H1>

There is a compatibility mode for HTTP
using the old "ascii" characters as control symbols and numbers:

<script>
for (
var i = 0;
i <= 255;
i = i + 1
)
{
var s = String.fromCharCode(i);
if (
s == encodeURI(s)
&&
s == encodeURIComponent(s)
)
document.write(s);
}
</script>

Out of:

<script>
for (
var i = 0;
i <= 255;
i = i + 1
)
{
var s = String.fromCharCode(i);
if (
s == encodeURI(s)
)
document.write(s);
}
</script>

Thereby:

$(Index'Tr3E)(v)

---

For @ and !, the Universal Contexts:

@time(Context'tree@host.tld)(üò¥) is an Associative Reference 
@time(Context'tree@host.tld) is the Context (and "file" name!)
@time(Context'tree@host.tld)() is the References "file"!

Same for !() and !()()

Or without time:

@(Context'tree@host.tld)
@(Context'tree@host.tld)()

These are the URI IRI URL "file name" or reference. at host.tld's interface, as declared in /@(@host.tld) or /@() ‚Äùfile" via host.tld

<!--
\n
(
~
(index'Tree)(v)
)

!'()*-.0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz~

Out of:

 !#$&'()*+,-./0123456789:;=?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz~ 

-->

---

<H1>Transport Syntax</H1>

HTTP and IRI (URI, URL) "% encode" everything except:

POST:

!'()*-.0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz~

GET & HEAD:

 !#$&'()*+,-./0123456789:;=?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz~ 

Of the available "ascii characters", 

<H2>63i Numbers:</H2>

0123456789
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_-

<H2>Control Symbols:</H2>

Per the available Symbols, and with the ~ in 0111111, the ' is , and the Syntax is $()()

# breaks in "IRI"
$ breaks in PHP, etc
* and : break in file systems
/ is IRI Path
punycode has mutilated -
and social media misuses _


POST:

!'()*.~

GET:

 !#$&'()*+,-./:;=?@~

Available for HTTP Transport:

!'(),.;@~

And POST:

!'().~

The containing Symbols ( "left hand" and ) "right hand"
combine with the ' as $((')(')'()())() 
to form (iNd3x'Turns) with (index)(Slots).

These numbers or Expanders (including "UTF8")
provide the tree's Turns and the set's Slots.

<H1>Universal Structure:</H1>


<H2>Structure:</H2>

A local, universal, context, and system table are each required:

~ System
! Universal
.() Local
@ Context

The system table is explicitly reserved for host implementations but includes the minimal standards for operation.

The ! Universal Context is well-formed and extensible by any !() or the abbreviated @().

ALL character encodings including those < 128
use Expanders of 2 or more octets with high bit set.

The 64 numbers are 00xxxxxx and mapped to ascii in the initial encodings.

The @(@) Context is a combination of the context tree and the supporting "named" host.

@(@) are typically a "UTF8" Expander or 6-bit number (or null) indicating the primary context,
@(üê©
then the optional context's tree with '
@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì
The @ Context delimiter
@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì@
and the UTF8 Expander
@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì@stfu.site
that can also have an "IRI" (URI, URL) styled path
@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì@stfu.site/demo.php/
or fully formed "IRI" in "UTF8" 2+ Byte Expander
@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì@https://stfu.site/demo.pho?x=
Closed with the ) other containing control symbol
@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì@stfu.site)

Because ALL characters are "UTF8" Expanders, there are no " quotes or other convolutions.

The "named" host assumes TLD, but can be any system type. ~(demo'tel'sms)(1'000'000'0000)

<H2>Where you at?</H2>

For @ and !, the Universal Contexts:

@time(Context'tree@host.tld)(üò¥) is an Associative Reference

@time(Context'tree@host.tld) is the Context (and "file" name!)

@time(Context'tree@host.tld)() is the References "file"!

Same for !() and !()()

Or without time:

@(Context'tree@host.tld)
@(Context'tree@host.tld)()

These are the URI IRI URL "file name" or reference. at host.tld's interface, as declared in /@(@host.tld) or /@() ‚Äùfile" via host.tld

<H2>Local Context:</H2>

Within a Context, indicated by the Tree of Turns,
there is content within:

@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì.(some'thing)@stfu.site)

The ' and . are handled the same as ~ and !
.(local'tree), though ' is exclusively Turns or Slots in sets. ( starts a turn or set of slots. Implied " (' ".

This Turn, .() indicates the next turns are inside the container or box.

!(~(wire)(~(bits)('''))'(in'set)'@(a@b)'ü§£.(3'ü§ó))

Because @(@) is a courtesy wrapper for !()(),
Both @(@) Context and all of the structures anywhere have the Turn Tree and the value.

In .(local'data)(this pair is a value, here it's an Expander)

The ' of Turns also functions the same way, allowing an in'set turn.

In any level, the ()((local'data)(value))

Or as a set of Slots:

()((local'data)(value)'RAW '(STFU8'UTF8)' in 2 octets or 10xxxxxxs '(local'STFU8'data'4)(value)'etc8s)

The @(@) Context and !() are the same way:

@(@)((local'data)(value))

Or more importantly

@(demo's0me'TrEe@stfu.site)(@(jack@twitter.com)(ü§ê))

Associative Reference!

This can map an @(@) or !() with the Associative Reference, typically a formally structured Syntax or an Expander suitable for the concept of inter-contextual association.

Internally at any level, any element in the tree can be associated to anything else:

.(local'data)(@(demo@stfu.site)(ü§¨))

Or

@(demo@stfu.site)(@(demo's0me'TrEe@stfu.site)(ü§™))

Or between specific data points inside the box:

@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì.(some'thing)@stfu.site)(@(demo's0me'TrEe.(local'data)@stfu.site)(ü§Ø))

Simple!

@(demo's0me'TrEe.(local'data)@stfu.site)(@(üê©'üòé'345'A'ü¶ì.(some'thing)@stfu.site)(üòú))


---
<H1>Associative Reference</H1>

Like the pair of @(@)(ü§ó) associations, any point in any context can have inter-related associations with any other, anywhere.

In !()() this is called "Cube" and "Ball" held left-hand and right-hand.

The "cube" is a box that holds stuff.

The "ball" is the Universal Context.

Your stuff is in the box, including your concepts of how other stuff is related (or not), anywhere.

Your "cube" has its own "ball" where references from anywhere else are posted for reference.

Any Associative Reference can have a diversity of attributes. This includes the standard set and any others that you can come up with, including association by another concept in any context.

<H2>Associative Syntax Structure</H2>

<H1>Initial Time + Re-Visioning</H1>

Accuracy of Representation is important. When you reference something you expect it to be accurate, not randomly changed into something else.

Control codes for previous & next allow the sequence in time to be loaded together.

A context could change to someone else, or become outdated.

@5i5i5i(@) or @5i5i(@)
!abCdEf(...)

allows for a n√ó6 bit initial time slice to be indicated, providing versioning and history and the References to it can be stored on the local time slice as well. msb aligned

@5i5i(@)() ALL THE REFERENCES!





---

<H1>Tools of Implementation</H1>

In order for your Concepts and References to be Accurately Represented, you need to use 


This can be loaded and referenced accurately in parallel starting at any point using an expanding tree or linked-list that has offsets.

Because the Control Symbols and Numbers are never STFU8 nor UTF8, they will always be accurate.

A \n newline is processed similar to the ' but only between 

The Context "file" @(@) has everything in this simple box.

Your Accurate Representation is shown in a "cube" with all your local references and any local references to anything else!

The Associated References "Ball" @(@)() "file" has ALL of the references to it from anywhere else and is open-ended so it can be appended.

Same for !() and !()()
